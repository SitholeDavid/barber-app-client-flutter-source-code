# barber_app_client

This is flutter app for barbershop and salon clients. The app allows clients to book in advance to be serviced at the shop. The clients can also pay for the services they require on the app and get reminders sent to them before their booking time.

The app utilizes Firebase FCM messaging, Firebase cloud storage, Firebase firestore and also Firebase Auth.

The payment gateway is provided through Paystack.

For state management the stacked and stacked_services packages were used. 

Get_It was used for dependency injection.

Abstraction was used for the service classes to make mock unit testing easier.
